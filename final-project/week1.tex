\maketitle
\indent This week I finished the depth first generator. Things are moving at a good pace and I am on track with my plan. The depth-first maze generator is pretty cool and I think that it works the way it should. This was a really fun algorithm to put in place and I am proud of the work that I did to get it to work. That being said, the code could be optimized some more because at times it is slow to run, for now the fact that it works is enough to keep my plan moving smoothly. In my plan for next week I have to complete the Kruskal's maze generator. Since the depth-first generator does not run as efficiently as I want it to I am going to spend some time and optimize that code as well.
