\title{Final Project Week 3 Update}

\maketitle
\indent This week my pace slowed down substantially, and I didn't get as much completed as I planned. I implemented the maze saving/printing and began to implement the solving game, but it proved to be more difficult than I anticipated and I ran out of time. I am still on track to complete the project by the end of next week, that just means I will have to spend a few extra hours working on it. That won't be a problem though because I have plenty of time! My goal is to complete the rest of the project. Completing the project means completing the maze solving mode, generating mazes using Kruskal's algorithm, and polishing the code/visuals of the project. The plan for the project is the same, it is just taking longer than planned.
