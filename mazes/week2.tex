\title{Final Project Week 2 Update}

\maketitle
\indent This week I was planning on creating the Kruskal's algorithm generator, but after reassessing my goals at the beginning of the week I decided to change them a little bit. Leaving the Kruskal algorithm until later, I worked on the flow of the application and polished up some minor visual/efficiency issues in the depth-first generator. I added an option to animate the generation of the maze or to have it generate instantly. Things are continuing to move at a good pace and I am satisfied with where I am at the end of this week. Next week I am going to make the maze solving game, and a mode where you can save the maze as an image to print it out later. If I get those done in a good amount if time then I will move on to creating the Kruskal maze algorithm. That would then leave me in a good place for the last week where I would have to finish up some final touches.
